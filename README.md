This is a course code and paper for NLP.This paper, based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology, designs and implements an efficient email classification system. It employs the Naive Bayes algorithm as the core classification model, combined with text preprocessing, TF-IDF feature extraction, and grid search tuning methods, ultimately achieving an accuracy rate of 98% on the test set. Experimental results demonstrate that the system can effectively distinguish between ham and spam, and the robustness of the model is verified through confusion matrix and threshold analysis. This paper further explores the feature weights of high-frequency spam keywords and their contribution to classification, providing data support for subsequent research.

这是NLP的课程代码和论文。本文基于自然语言处理（NLP）技术，设计并实现了一个高效的电子邮件分类系统。它采用朴素贝叶斯算法作为核心分类模型，结合文本预处理、TF-IDF特征提取和网格搜索调优方法，最终在测试集上实现了98%的准确率。实验结果表明，该系统能够有效地区分火腿和垃圾邮件，并通过混淆矩阵和阈值分析验证了模型的鲁棒性。本文进一步探讨了高频垃圾邮件关键字的特征权重及其对分类的贡献，为后续研究提供了数据支持。
